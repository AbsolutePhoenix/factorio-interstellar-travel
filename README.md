# Intersteller Travel

[![Release](https://github.com/AngellusMortis/factorio-interstellar-travel/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AngellusMortis/factorio-interstellar-travel/actions/workflows/release.yml) | [Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/interstellar-travel)

Fork of [TheTwonky](https://mods.factorio.com/user/TheTwonky)'s [Solar Systems](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SolarSystems) mod.

Adds up to 3 new star systems to help organize planet mods and add an extra layer of depth to space logistics requiring interstellar travel between the systems.

_Note:_ All screenshots taked with the [StarMap Background](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Better_Starmap_Background) mod.

## Features

- Add up to 3 new star systems: Miara, Twelpa and Jarbid. Miara and Twelpa are only added if there are planets within the system.
- Moves all Aquilo+ content to another star system (Jarbid) to force Interstellar logistic between systems
- Travel between Core Systems (Nauvis, Miara, and Twelpa) is restricted behind Space Science
- Travel to Fringe Systems (Jarbid) is restricted behind the 3 main planetary sciences (Vulcanus, Fulgora, Gleba)
- Combability with [Any Planet Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/any-planet-start), [Redrawn Space Connections](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Redrawn-Space-Connections), [rjdunlap](https://mods.factorio.com/user/rjdunlap)'s planet mods and [Enable all Planet Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/kry-all-planet-mods).

## Mod Compatibility

The mod _should_ be mostly compatible with any mod as it only changes space routes. It is safe to install mid-save, but **be warned**, it _will_ mess up your space routes if you are already on any planets not inside of the Nauvis system (see below).

The mod is **intended** to be used with the [Redrawn Space Connections](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Redrawn-Space-Connections) mod, [rjdunlap](https://mods.factorio.com/user/rjdunlap)'s planet mods and optionally the [Enable all Planet Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/kry-all-planet-mods). Playing the mod _without_ at least some planet mods to add to Jarbid will kind of make the interstallar travel less meaningful.

If you want to use [Any Planet Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/any-planet-start) and start on a planet that is _not_ in the Nauvis system, make sure you have the rjdunlap's planets that belong to that system or you may lock yourself out of other systems.

[Organized Solar System](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Tiered-Solar-System) is _not_ supported since each system has its own directionality, but the tier list from the mod was used to divide up all of the planets.

Any planet mod listed as an optional dependency should be fully supported. If the planet is _not_ listed, it will still work, but it will be placed in its default location in the Nauvis system.

## Systems

Planets are divided up between the systems, so each system has its own unique experience and enough planetary sciences to unlock Fringe System Travel.

Each of the core systems have a balanced amount of T1-T4 planets and all T5+ planets are in Jarbid only.

### Nauvis (T1-T4)

The default/Nauvis system is mostly unchanged. Except many planets have been _removed_ from the system. It still has Nauvis, Vulcanus, Fulgora, Gleba. In addition it has [Moshine](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Moshine), [Dyson Sphere](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/slp-dyson-sphere-reworked), [Cerys](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora) and [Terra Palus](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/terrapalus).

### Dea Dia and Redstar (Metal and Stars)

If you have the Dea Dia System install, it will not be the center point between the 4 systems.

Likewise, if you have Metal and Star installed, the Senestella Stargate will be in the middle point of the systems (inside of Dea Dia if you have that mod installed).
